\intslug[day]{Driskill Hotel Seminar Room}

JOE and APRIL burst through the doors into a clean, well-lit seminar room.

\begin{dialogue}{Joe}
    Are we in time?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{April}
    How could they start without us?
    We're the main attraction.
\end{dialogue}

Joe catches his breath as he leans against the podium at the front of the room.

\begin{dialogue}[looking about the room]{Joe}
    We are?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{April}
    Don't be a moron.  You know we've
    been invited to Austin to discuss
    script format.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Joe}
    But why is the room empty?
\end{dialogue}

April and Joe both look out across the room~-- rows of empty chairs and nary a person in sight.

\begin{dialogue}{April}
    Okay, okay, don't panic.
\end{dialogue}

She takes three deep breaths.  Then she looks at her watch
and smiles.

\begin{dialogue}[continuing]{April}
    We're an hour early.\dots  We should
    rehearse.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Joe}
    Okay, you start.  Margins?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{April}
    Left, 1.5 inches.  Right, 1.0
    inches.  Top, 1.0 inches to the
    body, 0.5 inches to the number.
    Bottom, 0.5 to 1.5 inches,
    depending on where the page break
    comes.
\end{dialogue}
